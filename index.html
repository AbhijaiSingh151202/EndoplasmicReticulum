                    <p class="text">
                        The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex organelle found in eukaryotic cells that plays a crucial role in the synthesis, processing, and transport of proteins and lipids. It occurs in 3 forms, namely- vesicles, long tubules and cisternae. From on side it is attached to the nuclear envelope (it separates the nucleus from cytoplasm) and from the other side it is attached to the plasma membrane/cell membrane. It is composed of two types: the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which has ribosomes on its surface, and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which lacks ribosomes. The ER is also involved in detoxification, calcium storage, and cellular communication.

                    <p class="text"> <b>1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER): </b><br>
                        <b>[ . ]</b> The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is so called because it appears rough under <br> the electron microscope due to the presence of ribosomes attached to its surface. <br><br> <b>[ . ]</b>  Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, and those attached to the RER synthesize proteins that are destined for secretion, membrane-bound proteins, and lysosomal proteins. <br><br> <b>[ . ]</b>  Once synthesized, the proteins are translocated into the lumen of the RER, where they are folded and modified. The RER is particularly important for the synthesis of proteins that are secreted by the cell or incorporated into the cell membrane.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <b>2. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER):</b> <br>
                        <b>[ . ]</b> The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) lacks ribosomes and appears smooth <br> under the electron microscope. <br> <br><b>[ . ]</b> The SER is involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism, detoxification of drugs and toxins, and calcium storage. It synthesizes phospholipids and steroids, which are important components of cell membranes. <br> <br><b>[ . ]</b> It also detoxifies drugs and toxins groups to them, making them more soluble and easier to excrete. Finally, the SER plays a critical role in calcium storage, releasing calcium ions into the cytoplasm when needed for various cellular processes.

                    <p class="text"><b>[ . ]</b> In addition to the specific functions of the RER and SER, the endoplasmic reticulum as a whole plays a role in cellular communication, cell growth and differentiation, and the formation of transport vesicles.<br><br><b>[ . ]</b> The ER is connected to the nuclear envelope, allowing it to communicate with the nucleus and regulate gene expression. The ER is also important for cell growth and differentiation, as it synthesizes the lipids and proteins needed for cell membrane expansion and specialization. <br><br><b>[ . ]</b> Finally, the ER plays a critical role in the formation of transport vesicles, which bud off from the ER and transport proteins and lipids to other organelles or the cell surface.</p>

                    <h3>Name Origin</h3>
                    <p>There are two reason that ER has such a long name: the first part of the name is because ‚Äúendoplasm‚Äù is the inside part of the cell‚Äôs cytoplasm. The second part is because ‚Äúreticulum‚Äù really means ‚Äúfine network.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Detox</h3>
                    <p>When there are lots of toxins present, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum can double its surface area to help clear them out. Because of this reason liver cells have large amounts of smooth endoplasmic reticulum !</p>
